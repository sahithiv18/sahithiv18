Here are a few highlights of my projects:
Here are a few highlights of my projects:

1. **User Management System**: Built a user management system using Django, providing features like user registration, login, and profile management.

2. **Automated Report Generation System (ARGS)**: Developed a system that takes a PDF as input and extracts information to generate reports automatically.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Worked on multiple projects involving data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

4. **Soil Health Predictor and Crop Recommendation**:
   - **Technologies**: Python, Neural Networks, Machine Learning
   - **Description**: Developed a model using Neural Networks to classify soil data and suggest crops based on soil features and obtained fertility score.

5. **Gender and Age Recognition**:
   - **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning
   - **Description**: Created a model to determine the gender and age of a person, either through a given image or the face detected by a camera.

6. **Deep Learning Based Violence Detection Model**:
   - **Technologies**: Python, Deep Learning, CNN, LSTM
   - **Description**: Developed a model using Deep Learning concepts like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model takes a video clip as input and determines whether the video is violent or non-violent.
